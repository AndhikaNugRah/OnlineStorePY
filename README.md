Consument Data Entry System

Objective:

The objective of this project is to design and implement a system that allows users to input their data into a MySQL database using both terminal-based and GUI-based interfaces. 

The system will also retrieve and display all records from the "consument" table.

Description:

This project is designed to create a user-friendly interface for storing customer data in a MySQL database. 

The system will allow users to enter their personal details, including name, sex, phone number, address, email, and birthdate. 

The entered data will be stored in a MySQL database using the "consument" table.

Features:

Terminal-Based Interface: Users can input their data through a terminal-based interface, where they will be prompted to enter the required details.

GUI-Based Interface (Using Tkinter): A GUI-based interface is also provided using Tkinter, which allows users to input their data in a form-based interface with drop-down menus and text fields.

Data Retrieval: The system will retrieve all records from the "consument" table and display them on the console.
